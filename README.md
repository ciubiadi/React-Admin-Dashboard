## React Admin Dashboard app

This dashboard is created from scratch with React.

### Prerequisites
* Material UI : https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/installation/
<!-- * FullCalendar : https://fullcalendar.io/docs/initialize-es6 -->
* Formik (&Yup) : https://formik.org/docs/overview

### Theme Setup
The theme colors were choosed based on #666666, #141b2d, #4cceac, #db4f4a, #6870fa. Using the Tailwind Shades vscode extension,
I was able to generate shades of theese main colors for the dark mode (by selecting the color and press Cmd+K and Cmd+G). The colors of the light mode were basically the same colors but sorted descendent with few exceptions.
