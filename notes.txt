Installation 
* Prerequisites
- react
- material ui
- Besides the MUI I install the datagrid which is the table of Material UI (it is bundled separately)
- add icons that Material UI have (this is also separate from the main package)
- react router 6
- react pro sidebar
- formik ( form library )
- yup ( validation library )
- Full Calendar ( package library for the calendar app
- Nivo charts
* VS Code Extensions
- Tailwind Shades ( to easily creates shades of colors )
- Pesticide for Chrome

File and Folder arhitecture - Project Structure :
- mockGeoFeatures.js is provided because Nivo charts needs it.
- The code is organized by features ( Duck's pattern )
- in the global folder I store the global parts of the app

Why use the hook useMemo for the theme?
- The useMemo Hook can be used to keep expensive, resource intensive functions from needlessly running. The useMemo hook returns
a memoized value, so basically it is caching a value so that it does not need to be recalculated. 

Material UI
- Box is like div but is very convinient because I can put css properties directly on the Box component ( in comparison with other 
component like InputButton, on which I need to use sx={{}}
